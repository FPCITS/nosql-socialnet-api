# NOSQL-SocialNetAPI

## Description

This project is to build an API for a social network web application in which users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list using Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.
This project was updated to be a UI for people who do not have Insomnia in which they can post and view data.
